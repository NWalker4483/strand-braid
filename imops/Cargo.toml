# Tests require std but crate itself should be no_std.
# Test that this remains true by building for a target without std:
#     cargo build --no-default-features --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf
default = ["std"]
std = ["machine-vision-formats/std"]

# This feature currently requires nightly but gives 5x-10x speedups.
