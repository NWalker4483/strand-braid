//! Type definitions for the Strand Camera Browser User Interface (BUI) system.
//!
//! This crate provides core data structures used in the Strand Camera ecosystem
//! for recording path management and clock synchronization between different
//! timing sources. These types are shared between the camera backend and the
//! web-based user interface.
//!
//! ## Core Types
//!
//! - [`RecordingPath`]: Manages file paths with timestamps and size tracking
//! - [`ClockModel`]: Linear clock synchronization between different time sources
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - Serialization support via serde for network communication
//! - UTC timestamp tracking for recording sessions
//! - Clock drift compensation for multi-camera synchronization

/// providing a timestamp for when the recording session began.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use strand_cam_bui_types::RecordingPath;
///
/// // Create a new recording path
/// let recording = RecordingPath::new("/path/to/video.mp4".to_string());
/// println!("Recording started at: {}", recording.start_time());

/// Linear clock synchronization model for multi-camera systems.
///
/// This structure implements a linear transformation to synchronize timestamps
/// between different clock sources (e.g., camera hardware clocks vs. host system clock).
/// The transformation follows the equation: `host_time = gain * device_time + offset`.
///
/// The clock model is essential for multi-camera synchronization in the Strand Camera
/// system, allowing timestamps from different sources to be aligned to a common
/// time reference.
///
/// # Mathematical Model
///
/// The linear relationship is: **t_host = gain Ã— t_device + offset**
///
/// - `gain`: Clock rate ratio (typically close to 1.0)
/// - `offset`: Time offset between clock sources
/// - `residuals`: Sum of squared residuals from the linear fit
/// - `n_measurements`: Number of data points used to compute the model
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use strand_cam_bui_types::ClockModel;
///
/// // Create a clock model with typical values
/// let clock_model = ClockModel {
///     gain: 1.000001,           // Slightly faster device clock
///     offset: -1234567.89,      // Device clock started earlier
///     residuals: 0.001,         // Good fit quality
///     n_measurements: 100,      // Based on 100 sync points
/// };
