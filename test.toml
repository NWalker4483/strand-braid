# Simple example of a Braid configuration TOML file

# The reference documentation for this file is
# https://strawlab.org/strand-braid-api-docs/latest/braid_config_data/struct.BraidConfig.html

# This configuration uses 3 emulated Basler cameras. Set the environment
# variable `PYLON_CAMEMU=3` to configure the Basler Pylon driver to emulate 3
# cameras. In normal usage, you would set your camera names here. There is one
# `[[cameras]]` section for each Strand Camera instance to be launched, and thus
# one such section for each camera.
